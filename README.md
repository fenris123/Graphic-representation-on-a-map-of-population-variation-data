This proyect is made as an example of a basic data analisys and graphic representation using R

On this file we are going to make a simple analisis of data population evolution inthe towns and provinces of spain from 2001 to 2021

We are going to use the data that we cleaned in a previous project: https://github.com/fenris123/population-data-cleaning-using-R


WE MUST RUN THE CODE OF THAT PROJECT AND SAVE THE TABLE "tabla_combinada" in a CSV file.

PLEASE, BE CAREFULL WITH THE FILE PATH THAT YOU SELECT.  WE SAVE IT IN C:/espacior/tabla_combinada.csv  
If you change it, you must obviously change it in the code of  this proyect.


The .shp files used in this proyect have been obtained from https://centrodedescargas.cnig.es/CentroDescargas/catalogo.do?Serie=CAANE

The projet is made using R markdown.

We include a markdonw file, an HTML file, and a raw txt file
